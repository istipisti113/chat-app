# kotlin-chat-app
This is a console-based chat app I built in my free time in Kotlin.
Please note that the database.txt file is important for the server in order to be able to save and load data from it, and the adresses.txt file is important for the client as well. 
Its kind of obvious, that you have to run the jvm file, but i posted the .kt file also so You will be able to check the source code, and make sure its not a malware.
