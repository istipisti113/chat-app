# kotlin-chat-app
This is a console-based chat app I built in my free time in Kotlin.
Please note that the database.txt file is important for the server in order to be able to save and load data from it, and the adresses.txt file is important for the client as well. 
Its kind of obvious, that you have to run the jvm file, but i posted the .kt file also so You will be able to check the source code, and make sure its not a malware.
If you want to host a server through the net you will have to forward the specified port where you are planning to host the server, and use your public ip. 
If you need any help feel free to ask. I'm planning to make a client for mobile (android) also, I'll post the mobile versions with the others.
The mobile versions will have an app or GUI or whatever, and not the console-based one.
I am also thinking about making a website that functions as a client, so you will be able to chat with anyoe on the go, if the server is already running.
